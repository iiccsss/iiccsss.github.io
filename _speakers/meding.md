Kristof obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master's degree in Neural Information Processing. During his PhD and PostDoc, he researched causal inference capabilities in human and computer vision under the supervision of Felix Wichmann from the University of Tübingen and Bernhard Schölkopf from the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems. Since 2022, he has been employed at the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Baden-Württemberg, where he focuses on addressing issues pertaining to data privacy and machine learning. More broadly, due to his current legal studies, Kristof is generally interested in the intersection of legal matters and machine learning.
