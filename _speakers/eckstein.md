Dr. Maria K. Eckstein is a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind in London, where she works at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence, usually by using tools and insights from AI to advance our understanding of the human mind and brain. She is particularly interested in human learning and decision making, using Reinforcement Learning modeling and neural networks to understand the cognitive algorithms that explain our behavior.
Before joining Google DeepMind, Maria completed her PhD in computational cognitive modeling at UC Berkeley, being supervised by Prof. Anne Collins. Before that, she was working towards a master's degree in neuroscience at the Graduate School of systemic Neurosciences in Munich, Germany. Maria holds a BA in philosophy as well as a BS in psychology, with a focus on clinical psychology.
