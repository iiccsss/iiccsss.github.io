Jennifer recently defended her Ph.D. in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, where she is advised by Roger Levy in the Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory. In fall 2023, she will start as a Research Fellow at the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University. Previously, she earned her B.A. from Harvard in Mathematics and Linguistics in 2018.

She is interested in the computational and cognitive principles that underlie the human capacity for language. Her research draws from a broad set of theoretical, experimental, and computational methods, with the dual goals of understanding the human mind and building better systems of artificial intelligence.
