John Jairo Madrid Carvajal is a Ph.D. student at the NeuroBioPsychology Lab directed by Peter König within the RTG "Situated Cognition." He received his MSc in Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University and his BA in Philosophy at the University of Antioquia (Colombia). His research interests lie at the intersection between neuroscience, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and philosophy. His current research focuses on embodiment and translating classical experimental paradigms into more practical and naturalistic setups by combining EEG and VR. More specifically, he investigates how to design, conduct, and analyze ecologically valid experiments to investigate the underlying neural correlates of human cognitive behavior.
