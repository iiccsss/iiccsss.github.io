After finishing his Ph.D. in Theoretical Neuroscience at the Philipps-Universiät Marbug in 2021, Marcel Binz is now working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Principles of Intelligence Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen.
Applying his background in cognitive science and machine learning, he wants to identify general principles of human learning and decision-making, with the ultimate goal of finding out why people do the things they do. To this end, he builds computational models of human behavior using tools from deep learning, reinforcement learning, information theory, and Bayesian inference.
