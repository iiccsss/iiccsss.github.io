IICCSSS 2023 will be a five-day in-person event in Tübingen, Germany, September 11–15, 2023.
There will be talks, interactive workshops, an institute tour and a hackathon.
We will announce our speakers soon.

## Fees
Many summer schools and conferences take high attendance fees. We want to make the event inclusive for everyone and keep the event free of charge. However, for your own commitment, you will be asked to pay a deposit of 20€. If you attend the summer school, we will reimburse the deposit.
You will also be reimbursed if you cannot make it (just [send us an email then](mailto:info@iiccsss.org)).

## Who can attend?
The event is targeted mainly at bachelor's and master's students in Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Linguistics and related fields. Also PhDs and postdocs are naturally very welcome.
However, due to limited room capacity, we have to limit the number of participants to a maximum of 75 people, assigned on a first come, first served basis.

## Travel grants
To promote attendance of students outside of Germany, we offer travel grants.
In order to apply for a travel grant, you will have to prove that you travel from abroad, and you should ideally sign up for active participation (see Participant contributions).
For more information, please [send us an email](mailto:info@iiccsss.org).

## Accommodation in Tübingen
We have reserved 36 beds in Tübingen’s [youth hostel](https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/youth-hostels/tuebingen-113/portrait), and we recommend staying there together for a better group experience. There are rooms with 2-4 beds, and breakfast is included for a price of 37.90€ per night. If you want to stay at the hostel, please indicate so in the registration form — again, first come first served! For people who want to organize their own accommodation, we recommend having a look at [uni accommodations](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/accommodation). Of course you can also try to book a place at the youth hostel directly (beyond our 36 beds reservation). Or you can book an AirBnB or couch-surf or camp...


## Participant contributions
Of course, the summer school is not only meant for you to listen to our speakers, but also to interact with and learn from your peers! A great way to do this is to present a project you are working on as a blitz talk (~15min). It is not necessary to commit to giving a presentation during registration, but in the registration form we will ask you to indicate how likely you are to present. We will then contact you again a little bit closer to the event, and ask you to provide more information.
