The registration will open in spring 2025.

### Participant contributions: Lightning talks
Participation in the summer school means not only listening to the invited speakers, but also interacting with and learning from your peers! A great way to do this is to present a project you are working on as a lightning talk (≤15 min). It is not necessary to commit to giving a lightning talk during registration, but in the registration form we will ask you to indicate how likely you are to present. We will then contact you again ahead of the event, and ask you to provide the title and abstract of your talk.
