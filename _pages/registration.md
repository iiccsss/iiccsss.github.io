### Registration fees
In the past, we were able to make participation in the summer school free of charge or keep registration fees low. We are working to keep it this way in 2024 as well.

### Who can attend?
The event is targeted mainly at bachelor's and master's students in cognitive science, neuroscience, linguistics and related fields.

### Accommodation in Osnabrück
We have reserved 28 spots for the summer school participants in the hostel ([Jugendherberge Osnabrück](https://www.jugendherberge.de/jugendherbergen/osnabrueck/)). These are spots in shared bedrooms ranging from 2 to 6 beds that cost €42.70/night (including breakfast).

### Participant contributions: Lightning talks
The summer school is not only meant for you to listen to our invited speakers, but also to interact with and learn from your peers! A great way to do this is to present a project you are working on as a lightning talk (~15 min). It is not necessary to commit to giving a presentation during registration, but in the registration form we will ask you to indicate how likely you are to present. We will then contact you again a little bit closer to the event, and ask you to provide more information about your talk.
