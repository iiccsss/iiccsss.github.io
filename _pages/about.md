The International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive Science Summer School (IICCSSS) is an annual educational meeting for students and young researchers interested in computational approaches to brain and cognitive sciences.

In 2023, we will have a one-week in-person event from the 11th to the 15th of September in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. Check out this year's [program](/program/) and the [speakers line-up](/speakers/)!

Organisation of the summer school is supported by the [Begegnungszonen](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/was-wir-tun/naturwissenschaften-begreifen/wissenschaftlicher-nachwuchs/begegnungszonen) of the [Joachim Herz Stiftung](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en) and the Computational Cognitive Science Colloquium e.V.
