The International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive Science Summer School (IICCSSS) is an annual educational meeting for students and young researchers interested in computational approaches to brain and cognitive sciences.

In 2025, IICCSSS will take place in Darmstadt. More information will follow soon. The last iteration of IICCSSS took place in Osnabr체ck, Germany, from September 9th to September 13th. In addition to the [invited talks and workshops](/speakers/), the summer school included a tour of Osnabr체ck research labs, a panel discussion, a contributed talks session, a hackathon, and a city rallye. Full program is available [here](/program/). IICCSSS 2025 will follow a similar program.

In the past years, the summer school was supported by [Universit채tsgesellschaft Osnabr체ck e.V.](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/universitaet/foerderung-und-sponsoring/kreis-der-foerderer/universitaetsgesellschaft/), the [Begegnungszonen](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/was-wir-tun/naturwissenschaften-begreifen/wissenschaftlicher-nachwuchs/begegnungszonen) of the [Joachim Herz Stiftung](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en), and the Computational Cognitive Science Colloquium e.V.
