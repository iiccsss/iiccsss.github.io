The International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive Science Summer School (IICCSSS) is an annual educational meeting for students and young researchers interested in computational approaches to brain and cognitive sciences.

**In 2025, IICCSSS will take place in Darmstadt, from 1st to 5th of September 2025**. More information about the program and registration will follow soon. The last iteration of IICCSSS took place in Osnabrück, Germany, from September 9th to September 13th. In addition to the [invited talks and workshops](/speakers/), the summer school included a tour of Osnabrück research labs, a panel discussion, a contributed talks session, a hackathon, and a city rallye. Full program is available [here](/program/). IICCSSS 2025 will have a similar program.

In the past years, the summer school was supported by [Universitätsgesellschaft Osnabrück e.V.](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/universitaet/foerderung-und-sponsoring/kreis-der-foerderer/universitaetsgesellschaft/), the [Begegnungszonen](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/was-wir-tun/naturwissenschaften-begreifen/wissenschaftlicher-nachwuchs/begegnungszonen) of the [Joachim Herz Stiftung](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en), and the Computational Cognitive Science Colloquium e.V.
