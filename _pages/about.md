The International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive Science Summer School (IICCSSS) is an annual educational meeting for students and young researchers interested in computational approaches to brain and cognitive sciences.

**In 2025, IICCSSS will take place in Darmstadt, from 1st to 5th of September 2025**. In addition to [invited talks and workshops](/speakers/), the summer school will include a tour of research labs, a panel discussion, a contributed talks session, a hackathon, and a city rallye. Full program will soon be available [here](/program/). 

In the past years, the summer school was supported by [Universitätsgesellschaft Osnabrück e.V.](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/universitaet/foerderung-und-sponsoring/kreis-der-foerderer/universitaetsgesellschaft/), the [Begegnungszonen](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/was-wir-tun/naturwissenschaften-begreifen/wissenschaftlicher-nachwuchs/begegnungszonen) of the [Joachim Herz Stiftung](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en), and the Computational Cognitive Science Colloquium e.V.
