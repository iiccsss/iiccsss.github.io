Depending on where you stand in your academic career you might have experienced one or another problem. Perhaps your mental health declined during your degree project? Your relationship with your supervisor impacted your work? You are unsure what and how you may express your needs in a professional context? 

Let us talk about the fucked up side of science during this event. We think sharing our experiences and talking about the “untalkable” brings us closer to finding solutions and allows us to validate our experiences. We will open the conversation about mindful science, gender-based discrimination, supervisor relations, work-life balance, and life during the PhD.
