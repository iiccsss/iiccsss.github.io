## Is this event for me?

Are you interested in state-of-the-art cognitive science research? Do you want to network with like-minded people? Are you looking for inspiration for your research topics or future academic career? If you answered 'yes' to any or all of these questions, this event is for you!

The course is designed for international Bachelor, Master, and PhD level participants from fields such as Computational and Experimental Neuroscience, Cognitive Science and Psychology. However, researchers and students from other fields with an interest in computational approaches to the brain and cognitive sciences are also warmly invited to join the event and contribute to an interdisciplinary atmosphere.

## What is special about this event?

We vividly remember the start of our academic journey. While it was different for all of us, we were all driven by the curiosity to learn and understand the mind and brain. Perhaps you, as some of us, also thought you would know what the 'mind' is after a year of studying? We quickly learned that to approach this answer, we need to ask more specific questions, take on different perspectives, and collaborate.

Therefore, this summer school focuses on interdisciplinary exchange and looking across topics and research approaches. We invite participants and speakers from different backgrounds, with a multitude of interests, and a diverse array of skills and perspectives, all unified in their interest to learn more about the working of the brain. We want to foster curiosity and connectivity, inviting you to look beyond your next assignment or data analysis, past your favorite subject or research project. You might find that a seemingly irrelevant or distant topic or research area might provide you with an idea or a spark that you were missing before. Our aim is to provide a space for sharing, discussing, and getting inspired by state-of-the-art research.

## What can you expect from the event?

We conceptualized this annual five-day summer school to be educational, collaborative, and active. We invite expert speakers to present and discuss their research or take you along their research tasks in workshop-style events. Participants are invited to actively contribute by presenting their work, and have the opportunity to exchange and work together in formal and informal settings.

Additionally, we are connected with the respective institutes in the hosting city to give you an insight to their ongoing research and facilities.
