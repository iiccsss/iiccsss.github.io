  <h2>Brain Computer Interfaces</h2>
  Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are techniques to connect the body with software or Neuroprosthetics, like artificial limbs. There are devices to restore senses, e.g. retinal implants for blind people, or to restore movement by analysing neural activity in the brain or at nerve endings.

 <ul>
   <li><b>Tanja Schultz</b> (University of Bremen) is a leading expert on the topic, especially for reading out neural activity to output speech.</li>
   <li><b>Lisa-Marie Vortmann</b> (University of Groningen) is an assistant professor, working on attention for BCIs using methods from Virtual Reality (VR).</li>
 </ul>

  <h2>Bridging Brains and ANNs</h2>
A longstanding goal of Cognitive Science is to build artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can not only predict labels of data (e.g. images) accurately, but also do so in a way that resembles brain activity. Conditioning ANN design on brain data may not only improve performance but also improve our models of the neural processes, e.g. animal vision or human speech.
 <ul>
   <li><b>Tim Kietzmann</b> (University of Osnabrück) is a professor advocating for the "neuroconnectionist" research programme, especially for modelling recurrency in vision.</li>
   <li><b>Johannes Mehrer</b> (EPFL) also works with ANNs, studying differences in architecture and data bias, in order to align artificial and biological neural representations better.</li>
   <li><b>Katja Seeliger</b> is a Postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig. She studies vision in neural networks and using MRI studies.</li>
 </ul>

  <h2>Automated Scientific Discovery</h2>
Automated Scientific Discovery is an emerging research field, that tries to automate the search for computational models, e.g. for human behaviour, and thereby accelerate the progress of science.
 <ul>
   <li><b>Sebastian Musslick</b> (University of Osnabrück) invented the framework of AutoRA (Automated Research Assistant), which automatically designs experiments, collects and analyses data, to then optimise the experiment.</li>
   <li><b>Kevin Miller</b> (University College London and DeepMind) works on finding Recurrent Neural Networks models for explaining human choices in value-based decision-making.</li>
   <li><b>Jannis Born</b> works at IBM Research in Zurich on generative/language models for molecular design and other scientific discovery applications.</li>

  <h2>Special events</h2>
  <h2>Science communication seminar</h2>  
  What's the use of great science, if it does not reach the general public? Why work long hours at the lab, if most people will not understand what you do? Most scientists spend way too little time communicating what they have found. But how should they know if they don't get training and academia does not incentivise it?
  <b>Katharina Stein</b> is a professional science communication trainer. She will give a workshop on how to talk in public and help you get better presenters.

  <h2>What's next? Careers in Cognitive Science</h2>
In this year's <b>panel discussion</b>, we will discuss the different career paths that are open to cognitive scientists. We are thrilled to be joined by four accomplished professionals who have graciously agreed to share their experiences with us. We will also collect your thoughts and questions for the panelists throughout the week and incorporate them into the discussion.
  <ul>
	<li>
	<b>Lisa-Marie Vortmann</b> is an assistant professor at the University of Groningen, working on attention for BCIs using methods from Virtual Reality.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Niklas Wilming</b> works as an AI specialist for Rosen, an international company with more than 4.000 employees, providing asset integrity management and consulting services to businesses around the world.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Justin Shenk</b> has worked for Intel and multiple start-ups before founding VisioLab, a Berlin-based start-up for AI-powered visual self-checkout.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>FeelSpace</b> is an Osnabrück-based startup developing a belt to help the blind navigate and orient themselves. We will be joined by one of their co-founders, either Susan Wache, CMO, or Silke Kärcher, CEO.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Thomas Klein</b> from the IICCSSS team will moderate the panel. Thomas is currently pursuing his PhD on explainable models for vision science at the MPI for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen.
