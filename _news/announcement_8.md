IICCSSS 2024 will take place in Osnabrück, Germany! [The Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de) in Osnabrück was the first in Germany to offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs in cognitive science. Today, it is home to several intedisciplinary research groups, and a lively community of students. We look forward to a week of science and fun in Osnabrück this September!
